Build a production-ready Admin Dashboard (backend) for an ecommerce site called 444EVER Candles that sells handmade candles. The dashboard must allow admins to manage products, inventory, orders, shipping, payments, customer communications, promotions, and light CRM features. Optimize for an efficient small-team workflow (1–5 admins). The UI should be clean, modern, fast, and mobile-responsive.

1) Goals & Principles

Single pane of glass for daily operations: fulfill orders, update products/prices, track sales, run promotions, communicate with customers.

Auditability: every critical change (price changes, refunds, stock changes, shipment updates) creates an audit log.

Role-based access: Owner/Admin/Staff/Read-only roles.

Replit-ready: easy local dev + cloud deploy; simple env config; seed data; migrations.

2) Recommended Tech (choose sensible defaults)

Frontend Admin UI: Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (or similar component library).

Backend API: Node/TypeScript with REST (or tRPC) and server actions where appropriate.

Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.

Auth: Admin login with email/password + optional 2FA (TOTP), session-based.

Email: transactional email provider (SendGrid/Mailgun) abstraction with templates.

Payments: Stripe integration (webhooks for payment success, refunds, disputes).

Shipping: support manual shipping + optional shipping label provider integration (Shippo/EasyPost) behind an abstraction.

3) Admin Dashboard Navigation (Left Sidebar)

Implement these sections with routes, components, and API endpoints:

Overview

Orders

Products

Inventory

Customers

Promotions

Email & Templates

Reports & Analytics
